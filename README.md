# Active-Product-Sales-Analysis-using-Matplotlib-in-Python
Active Product Sales Analysis?
This refers to analyzing the sales performance of products that are currently available or being actively sold. The goal is to:

Track which products are selling well.

Identify trends in product demand.

Monitor underperforming items.

Support decision-making in inventory, marketing, and sales strategies.
 

Use Python?
Python is a powerful, versatile language that’s widely used in data analysis due to:

Easy syntax.

A large ecosystem of data science libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

Great support for handling and visualizing large datasets.

Use Matplotlib?
Matplotlib is a Python library used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It’s especially useful for:

Line charts (e.g., sales over time).

Bar charts (e.g., sales by product).

Pie charts (e.g., sales distribution).

Customizing plots with titles, labels, legends, and colors.

What Does a Sales Analysis Workflow Look Like?
1. Data Collection
Sales data is collected, often from CSV files, databases, or APIs.

Data includes: product name, quantity sold, sale date, revenue, etc.

2. Data Cleaning and Filtering
Filter to only include "active" products.

Handle missing or incorrect data.

3. Data Analysis
Group and summarize sales by product.

Calculate metrics: total sales, revenue, average order size, etc.

4. Data Visualization with Matplotlib
Example uses:

Bar Chart to compare sales volume across products.

Line Graph to show how sales trend over time.

Pie Chart to visualize the share of total sales by product.
